Hello, my dear brother, Alex!
Listen, there's something I need to say to you
I've been thinking about it a long time but I couldn't find the words
Until now

I f*cking hate you
You're the worst
Everything that you do
Is really annoying

If you were drowning
I would smile
I don't like you
On a personal level

I f*cking hate you
You're the worst
I f*cking hate you

And if you died
I know I'd cry
Tears of joy from deep inside
You'll waste away while we celebrate
It may seem harsh
But you're a dick
(Eat shit)

I think I said everything I needed to say
I hope this doesn't come as too much of a surprise
I just want you to know I meant every word of it
Every syllable,
Whole this program, that you see,
Truly and sincerely from the bottom of my heart...
